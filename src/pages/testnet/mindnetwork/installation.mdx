```
modify myconfig.ts to suit your needs
```
nano myconfig.ts
```
```
export const appKey = "YOUR_APP_KEY";
export const nodeUrl = "https://sdk.mindnetwork.xyz"; // or change to other node url
export const aliceWalletAddress = "Alice_Wallet_Address";
export const bobWalletAddress = "Bob_Wallet_Address";
export const charlieWalletAddress = "Charlie_Wallet_Address";
```
after modifying myconfig.ts continue with Executing the Examples.
