### Warn

Only the first prover can earn the TTKO reward, and others will be rejected by the protocol smart contract. This means the fastest prover will be able to prove the block and earn the reward, if you have just the minimum hardware outlined in the prerequisited below, running a single prover, it's unlikely you will be able to prove any blocks (because you will be competing against other high-performance provers).

Meaning, if you do not have a powerful prover, the primary purpose of running a prover is to help test out and provide community feedback on running the node software. Keep in mind this will have a cost in electricity on your computer, and if you are not proving blocks, it's unlikely you will receive a reward to offset that electricity cost.


### Requirements
- Must have a balance of ETH on Sepolia, Faucet List : https://taiko.xyz/docs/guides/receive-tokens
- Node set up
- Should have at least 8/16 core CPU and 32GB of RAM

## Guide

### Edit .env
```
cd simple-taiko-node
nano .env
```

- Set ENABLE_PROVER to `true` (replacing the default `false` with `true`).
- Set L1_PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY to that of your wallet's private key; it will need some ETH on Sepolia to prove blocks
